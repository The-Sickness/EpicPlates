Overview:
I've created EpicPlates to give you full control over your nameplates, especially if you're into PvP like me. I wanted something that not only looks good but also gives a clear, tactical advantage during those intense battles. EpicPlates is all about customizing your UI to fit your playstyle perfectly, helping you stay focused and effective whether you're deep in the action or gearing up for the next big fight. 

 

The idea of this addon came from seeing other similar addons that have not been updated in some time. I got my inspiration from them and added more features that I think will make it stand out. But, you the players get to decide that, not me. So I hope you all enjoy it. 

 

Features:
Health Percentage Display:

For players who need precise information about their target’s health, EpicPlates offers the option to display the exact health percentage directly on the nameplate's health bar. This feature is particularly useful for situations where knowing the exact health can influence your combat decisions, such as in PvP or high-end PvE encounters. The health percentage is displayed in a customizable font color, allowing you to match it with your UI’s theme.
 

Customizable Icon Layout:

EpicPlates gives you complete control over how aura icons are displayed. You can adjust the size, position, and offset of buff and debuff icons to better fit your UI. Icons can be arranged in multiple rows, with flexible spacing to prevent overlapping and ensure that all critical information is clearly visible. This level of customization allows you to create a UI layout that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Timer Settings:
Custom Timer Fonts: Select your preferred font for the timer text displayed on buff and debuff icons. This allows you to maintain visual consistency with the rest of your UI.
Adjustable Timer Font Size: Change the size of the timer font to ensure readability without cluttering your screen.
Dynamic Countdown Colors: Enable dynamic coloring for the timer text, which starts green and gradually shifts to red as the timer runs out. This feature provides a clear visual cue for when buffs or debuffs are about to expire.
Custom Timer Font Color: If dynamic colors aren’t your style, you can set a fixed color for the timer text to match your UI or preferences.
Timer Font Positioning: Choose where the timer text appears on the icons—either centered within the icon, just below it for easy reading, or disable the timer entirely for a cleaner UI.
 
Minimap Icon:

For quick and easy access to the addon's settings, EpicPlates includes a minimap icon. This icon serves as a convenient shortcut, enabling you to open the options menu with a single click. If you prefer to keep your minimap uncluttered, the icon can also be hidden through the settings, giving you control over your UI’s appearance.
 

Aura Filters:
Filter by Spell ID: Hide specific spells from being displayed on nameplates by entering their numerical ID. This is great for filtering out unnecessary or distracting auras.
Filter by Spell Name: Similar to the ID filter, but based on the spell’s name. This option is useful if you’re more familiar with spell names than IDs.
Filter by Caster Name: Hide all auras cast by a specific character. This feature is particularly useful in PvP to ignore buffs or debuffs from certain opponents.
Remove Filters: Easily remove any of the applied filters, bringing back the auras you previously hid.
 
Always Show Spells:
Always Show by Spell ID: Ensure that specific spells are always visible on nameplates by entering their numerical ID. This is essential for tracking crucial buffs or debuffs.
Always Show by Spell Name: Similar to the ID option, but based on the spell’s name. Keep important auras in view, no matter what.
Remove Always Show Spells: If you no longer need to track a spell, you can easily remove it from the always-show list.
 
Aura Display Controls:
Show Auras with More Than X Seconds: This setting allows you to control which auras are displayed on nameplates based on their remaining duration. By specifying a minimum number of seconds, you ensure that only auras with more than this amount of time left are visible. This feature is particularly useful for focusing on longer-lasting buffs or debuffs that have a significant impact on gameplay. For instance, if you set this to 10 seconds, any aura with less than 10 seconds remaining will be hidden from the nameplate, allowing you to concentrate on the more persistent effects that might require your attention over a longer period.

 
Show Auras with Less Than X Seconds: This setting provides the opposite functionality by controlling the display of auras with less than the specified number of seconds remaining. It's especially useful for tracking auras that are close to expiring. For example, if you set this to 5 seconds, only those auras with 5 seconds or less remaining will be shown on nameplates. This is crucial in situations where timing is everything, such as in PvP or high-pressure PvE encounters, where knowing when a debuff is about to expire could mean the difference between winning or losing an engagement. This setting ensures you stay on top of those critical moments in combat.

 
Always Show Important Spells:
EpicPlates ensures that critical auras are always visible on your nameplates, regardless of other filtering settings. By specifying important spells through their spell ID or name, you can guarantee that these auras will never be filtered out. This feature is invaluable for tracking key buffs or debuffs that can significantly impact the outcome of a battle, ensuring that you never miss important information.

Add Filter by Spell ID:
This setting allows you to filter out specific spells from being displayed on nameplates by entering their numerical ID. Each spell in World of Warcraft has a unique ID associated with it, and by using this feature, you can ensure that auras associated with a particular spell are hidden from your view. This is particularly useful when you want to declutter your UI by removing auras that are irrelevant to your strategy or when you need to focus only on the most critical buffs or debuffs. Simply input the Spell ID, and the addon will automatically filter out that spell, keeping your nameplates clean and focused.


Add Filter by Spell Name:
This setting offers a more intuitive way to filter out spells by allowing you to input the name of the spell you wish to hide. Unlike the Spell ID filter, which requires you to know the exact ID number, this feature lets you filter auras simply by typing the spell's name. This is especially useful for players who prefer to manage their filters based on the spell names they are familiar with rather than having to look up ID numbers. By adding a spell name to the filter, you ensure that any aura associated with that spell will not be displayed on nameplates, helping you concentrate on the buffs or debuffs that matter most to your gameplay.

Add Filter by Caster:
This setting allows you to filter auras based on the source or caster of the spell. By specifying the name of the caster, you can choose to hide all auras applied by that particular player, NPC, or even yourself. This feature is invaluable in scenarios where certain casters consistently apply buffs or debuffs that you do not need to monitor, allowing you to eliminate unnecessary information from your nameplates. For example, in PvP, you might want to filter out auras cast by a certain class or player to avoid being overwhelmed by too much information. By focusing only on the casters that matter, you can streamline your nameplates for more efficient tracking.
